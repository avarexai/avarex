# Avarex Whitepaper (v1.0)

## Abstract

Avarex is an autonomous execution protocol for decentralized finance. It enables vaults, DAOs, and funds to execute capital strategies via smart agents and intent-based logic flows — without UI, without manual triggers, and without centralized coordination.

---

## Problem

DeFi today still depends on dashboards, clicks, multisig approvals, and fragmented coordination. This creates:

- Latency in strategy execution
- Risks from human error
- Poor scalability for large capital operations

---

## Solution: Intent-as-Code

Avarex introduces intent-driven execution:

- Define capital logic flows once
- Agents monitor on-chain and off-chain conditions
- Execution is triggered automatically and verifiably

---

## Core Components

- AvarexExecutor.sol — Main contract for executing strategy logic  
- AI Coordination Layer — Listens to signals and decides when to act  
- Vault Connectors — Interfaces with capital vaults  
- Verification Filters — Ensure only allowed flows execute

---

## Use Cases

- Vault automation
- Liquidity rebalancing
- DAO treasury execution
- Yield compounding
- Cross-chain strategy routing

---

## Token Model (Draft)

If launched, $AVX will be used for:

- Agent rewards  
- Governance of logic filters  
- Security bonding for validators

(TBD: launch date, supply, emissions)

---

## Roadmap Summary

See [docs/roadmap.md](roadmap.md)

---

## Team

Anonymous core contributors across smart contracts, system design, and DeFi strategy.

---

## Final Notes

Avarex is not an app. It's a base-layer protocol for executing trustless, pre-defined, autonomous financial logic.
