# Architecture Overview

Avarex is a system of autonomous agents executing on-chain capital strategies via smart contracts. It operates without a frontend or manual input.

### Core Components

- Intent Engine – Encodes strategy logic as executable flows  
- Agent Layer – Listens to system state and triggers flows  
- Liquidity Router – Routes capital through optimal paths  
- Compliance Filters – Enforces limits, constraints, and roles

Execution is fully on-chain, composable, and deterministic.
